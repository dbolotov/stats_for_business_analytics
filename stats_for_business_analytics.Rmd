# Section 2: Distributions

## Continuous vs Discrete
- Continuous variables can take any real value without any restrictions.
- Discrete variables can only take specific values.
- Example: foot size (continuous) vs shoe size (discrete)

## What is a distribution?
- A probability distribution is a mathematical function that can be thought of as providing the probability of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution)).
- A distribution is a function linked to the underlying observations.
- A distribution provides the probability that an observation has a specific value.

### Visualizing distributions
- Discrete distributions are represented by bar charts, where the sum of all bar heights adds up to 1.
- Continuous distributions are visualized by a curve (probability density function). 
	- The probability of an exact value (on the x axis) is 0, and there is an unlimited amount of numbers. 
	- Probability is quantified as the area under the curve between two numbers: P(a < x b) = shaded area; calculated by integration. 
	- The total area under the curve is 1.

## What is standard deviation?
- Variance is a measure of spread of the data about the mean: $$\sigma^2 = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^N(x_i - \mu)^2}{N}.$$ Variance is low when the spread of the data is low.
- Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is useful because it is defined in the same units as the original data and the mean.

## Normal distribution
- Defined by the probability density function $$p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}.$$.
- For a normal distribution, the probability of an observation falling between the mean and 1 $\sigma$ away is 34.1%. Probability of falling between $-2\sigma$ and $+2\sigma$ is 95.4%.
