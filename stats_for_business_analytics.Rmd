# Section 2: Distributions

## Continuous vs Discrete
- Continuous variables can take any real value without any restrictions.
- Discrete variables can only take specific values.
- Example: foot size (continuous) vs shoe size (discrete)

## What is a distribution?
- A probability distribution is a mathematical function that can be thought of as providing the probability of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution)).
- A distribution is a function linked to the underlying observations.
- A distribution provides the probability that an observation has a specific value.

### Visualizing distributions
- Discrete distributions are represented by bar charts, where the sum of all bar heights adds up to 1.
- Continuous distributions are visualized by a curve (probability density function). 
	  - The probability of an exact value (on the x axis) is 0, and there is an unlimited amount of numbers. 
	  - Probability is quantified as the area under the curve between two numbers: P(a < x b) = shaded area; calculated by integration. 
	  - The total area under the curve is 1.

## What is standard deviation?
- Variance is a measure of spread of the data about the mean: $$\sigma^2 = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^N(x_i - \mu)^2}{N}.$$ Variance is low when the spread of the data is low.
- Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is useful because it is defined in the same units as the original data and the mean.

## Normal distribution
- Defined by the probability density function $$p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}.$$
- For a normal distribution, the probability of an observation falling between the mean and 1 $\sigma$ away is 34.1%. Probability of falling between $-2\sigma$ and $+2\sigma$ is 95.4%.

## Skewness
- Distributions can be left (negative) skewed (longer tail on left) or right (positive) skewed (longer tail on right).
    - A left-skewed distribution has more outliers on the left.

## Mean, Median, Mode
- Include duplicates when calculating these statistics if duplicates are present in the data.
- For a right-skewed distribution, the median is to the right of the mean, and the mode is to the right of the median. To remember the order: the 3 statistics are in alphabetical order for a left-skewed distribution.
- The median is usually not affected by outliers as much as the mean.

# Section 3: Central Limit Theorem

## Populations & Samples
- A sample is a subset of the population.
- Parameters of a population: $N$ (number of observations in population), $\mu$ (mean), $\sigma$ (standard deviation).
    - Parameters are attributed to the whole population.
- Statistics of a sample: $n$ (number of observations in sample), $\bar{x}$ (sample mean), $s$ (sample standard deviation).
    - The statistics of a sample are used to assess the parameters of the population.

## Sampling Distribution
- Taking samples is not always useful, and should be solved with more advanced techniques. The sampling distribution is discussed here for this purpose.
- The sampling distribution is a set of samples of observations (e.g., each sample might have 10 observations, and there are a total of 20 such samples in the set). For each sample, take a mean. All the statistics make up the *sample distribution of the sample mean*.

## Central Limit Theorem
- Said to be one of the most important theorems in math and statistics.
- CLT states that given enough samples, the sample distribution of the sample mean looks like a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the original population.

## Central Limit Theorem - Intuition
- The mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean equals the mean of the original distribution: $\mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu$. The sample means are distributed around the mean of the original distribution.
    - This is useful because the true mean of the population is not known.
- The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is related to the standard deviation of the population: $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the original population and $n$ the number of observations in each sample.

## Central Limit Theorem - Visualization
- Visualize CLT at [onlinestatbook.com](http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/index.html).
- The sample distribution gets closer to normal when $n$ is large.


## Z-Score (aka Standard Score, Normal Score, Normalized Variable)
- Percentage of observations between standard deviations: -1 to 1: 68.2%, -2 to 2: 95.4%, -3 to 3: 99.8%.
- Z-score is defined as $Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$. It is the amount of standard deviations that a point $x$ is away from the mean $\mu$.
- Applied to all values, this procedure transforms the data to have $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$. A distribution with such mean and standard deviation is said to be normalized.
- Standard normal probability tables can be used to find probabilities.

## Hands-On CLT - Analytics Challenge

### Challenge

- You are a Business Analyst working for FedEx.
- A business client has requested a large freight to be transported urgently from Denver to Salt Lake City. When asked about the weight of the cargo they could not supply the exact weight, however they have specified that there are a total of 36 boxes. 
- From prior experience with this client you know that this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of $\mu$ = 72lb (32.66kg) and a std. dev. of $\sigma$ = 3lb (1.36kg).
- The only plane you currently have at Denver is a *Cessna 208B Grand Caravan* with a max cargo weight of 2630lb (1193kg).
- Based on this information what is the probability that all of the cargo can be safely loaded onto the plane and transported?

### Solution
- We know that the population parameters are $\mu$ = 72 and $\sigma$ = 3, but we don't know what the distribution looks like (most likely, the distribution is not normal).
- We know that the sampling distribution of the sample mean looks like a normal distribution. We also know that the mean of this sampling distribution is the same as $\mu$, and standard deviation of the sampling distribution is $\sigma/sqrt{n}$, where $n$=36.
- The plane capacity is 2640lb, so the critical mass for each box is $x_{crit} = \frac{2640lb}{36 boxes} = 73.06 lb/box$. This amount is to the left of the sample mean $\mu_{\bar{x}}.
- Calculate how far $x_{crit}$ is from $\mu$: $z = \frac{x_{crit} - \mu_{bar{x}}}{\sigma_{\bar{x}}} = \frac{73.06-72}{0.5}=2.12$.
- Find 2.12 in a z-score probability table: $P(x < x_{crit}) = 0.9830 = 98.3%$.
- Therefore, the probability that the cargo can be safely loaded onto the plane is 98.3%.

# Section 4: Hypothesis Testing

## Hypothesis Testing Steps
- Challenge: In 2015, millenials were watching 26.5 hours of TV a week with a $\sigma$ of 10 hours. Today you surveyed 50 millenials and found that they watch 24 hours of TV per week. Has the parameter decreased?
- Steps:
	- State the null hypothesis - $H_0$: the parameter has not decreased, i.e. $\mu \gte 26.5$.
	- State the alternative hypothesis - $H_1$: the parameter has decreased, i.e. $\mu < 26.5$.
		- Note: if we reject $H_0$, we can't say that the average is 24 hours. We can only say that the average has decreased.
	- Apply the concepts from CLT:
		- $\mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu = 26.5$.
		- $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ = \frac{10}{\sqrt{50}} = 1.41$.
		- $\bar{x} = 24$.
	- Ask the question: how likely that we just randomly picked a sample of 50 millenials with a sample mean $\bar{x}$ that is so far away from the sample mean? Put another way: assuming that $H_0$ is true, how likely is it that we picked $\bar{x}$ at random?
	- Calculate the z-score: $z = \frac{24 - 26.5}{1.41} = -1.77$. 
	- So the p-value is $P = 0.0384 = 3.84%$ (found in probability table).
		- This is interpreted as: the probability of picking $\bar{x} to be 24 or less is 3.84%.
		- This value is less than 5%, so with 95% confidence, we reject the null hypothesis. We accept $H_1$, that the parameter is less than 26.5.
